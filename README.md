### Project Description
---

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of operational and customer data for Café Harmony, a fictional café chain, using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to evaluate core business areas—including sales performance, customer feedback, employee efficiency, and inventory management. Leveraging pivot tables, charts, and advanced Excel formulas, interactive dashboards were developed to uncover actionable insights. These insights support informed decision-making aimed at improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer experience, and guiding strategic planning.

### Business Introduction
---
Café Harmony is a growing virtual café chain that offers a wide variety of beverages, pastries, and light meals across multiple urban locations. As customer demand rises and operations become more complex, management recognized the need to gain clearer insights into performance trends, customer preferences, and supply chain efficiency. This project was initiated to convert raw business data into meaningful insights—enabling more informed decision-making in areas such as marketing, staffing, inventory management, and enhancing the overall customer experience.

### Problem Statement
---
As Café Harmony expanded across multiple locations, it encountered growing challenges in interpreting its increasing volume of business data. Management lacked clear visibility into critical areas such as top-selling menu items, customer satisfaction, employee performance, and stock availability. The absence of data-driven insights made it difficult to optimize operations, minimize stockouts, and improve the overall customer experience. This project was initiated to analyze the business data and uncover actionable insights that would support strategic decision-making and drive operational efficiency.

### Aim of the Project
---
This project aims to analyze Café Harmony’s business data using Microsoft Excel to generate actionable insights that improve operational efficiency, increase sales performance, and elevate customer satisfaction. Through the use of Excel dashboards and data visualizations, the project focuses on evaluating menu performance, understanding customer behavior, assessing employee productivity, and optimizing stock management across multiple café locations.

### Methodologies Used

### Problem Statement:
---

- Customers are highly dissatisfied, and products are constantly running low.
  
**Why #1:**
- Why are customers dissatisfied?
- Because the products they want are frequently out of stock.
  
**Why #2:**
- Why are the products frequently out of stock?
- Because inventory levels are not being replenished in time to meet customer demand.
  
**Why #3:**
- Why is inventory not being replenished in time?
- Because there is poor demand forecasting and supply chain planning.
  
**Why #4:**
- Why is demand forecasting and supply chain planning poor?
- Because the company lacks accurate sales data analysis and has no dynamic restocking
  system in place.

**Why #5:**
- Why is there no accurate data analysis or dynamic restocking system?
- Because there is insufficient investment in technology and process improvement for
  inventory management.
  
### Root Cause:
---

- Insufficient inventory management processes and the absence of data-driven demand forecasting are leading to frequent product shortages. These stockouts are directly contributing to increased customer           dissatisfaction and missed sales opportunities.

### Insights Derived
---

The analysis of Café Harmony’s Excel dashboard revealed valuable insights across core business areas:

**1. Sales Performance Insights**

- Total sales reached $12.6K, with strong revenue contributions from key menu items.

- Muffin was the top-selling item, generating $2.4K, followed by Cappuccino and Iced Tea—highlighting a strong customer preference for baked goods and beverages.

- 3,000 units were sold across 1,000 transactions, reflecting healthy product movement and overall sales activity.

**2. Customer Behavior Insights**

- The most profitable customer segment was females aged 33–45, contributing $6,823, indicating this group is highly valuable.

- Females accounted for 54% of total revenue, slightly outspending male customers.

- Popular product choices included muffins, iced tea, and cappuccinos, offering guidance for targeted promotions and stocking strategies.

**3. Stock Management Insights**

- 50% of stock items fell below their ideal levels, with key ingredients like Milk, Tea Bags, Muffin Mix, and Croissant Dough frequently running low.

- This indicates the need for proactive inventory planning to prevent stockouts and maintain service quality for high-demand products.

**4. Customer Feedback Insights**

- Only 32% of customer feedback was positive, while 34% was neutral and another 34% negative.

- Repeated feedback such as "Could be better" suggests gaps in service quality or product consistency, highlighting areas for customer experience improvement.

These insights empower Café Harmony to make data-informed decisions across critical areas, including operations, marketing, inventory management, and customer experience.

  
### Recommendations:
---

- Implement inventory management software with real time tracking.
- Improve sales data analysis to better predict demand patterns.
- Establish automated restocking triggers based on minimum inventory thresholds.
- Train supply chain staff on demand forecasting techniques.
- Regularly review customer feedback to identify popular or high
  demand products early.
